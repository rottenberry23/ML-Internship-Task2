# Customer Segmentation  
**Task 2 - Machine Learning Internship at Elevvo Pathways**

This repository contains an unsupervised learning project aimed at segmenting mall customers into distinct groups based on their income and spending score. This project was completed as **Task 2** of the Machine Learning Internship at Elevvo Pathways.

---

## Objectives

- Explore and preprocess the **Mall Customers dataset**  
- Perform data scaling and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Apply **K-Means clustering** to group customers  
- Determine the **optimal number of clusters** using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score  
- Visualize customer segments in 2D plots  

---

## Tools and Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab  

---

## Models Implemented

1. **K-Means Clustering** (with optimal k determined via Elbow Method)  
2. **K-Means Clustering with visualization** (Income vs. Spending Score)  
3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)** for alternative segmentation  

---

## Visualizations

- Elbow Method plot for cluster selection  
- Silhouette Score analysis  
- Customer segments (Income vs. Spending Score)  
- DBSCAN clustering comparison  

---

## Dataset

- **Mall Customers dataset** from Kaggle  
(Link to the dataset can be added here)

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab or a local environment  
3. Run all cells to execute data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization

## Project Status

- Core task completed  
- Bonus tasks completed (DBSCAN + spending analysis)  
- Notebook ready for review and feedback
